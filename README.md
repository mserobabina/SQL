# Queries in PostgresSQL

 DDL was used to create tables, update the fields in an existing table. A set of commands were used to manipulate data stored in database.
 
 ## Data Engineering
- Using the information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
- Specifing data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints
- Import each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table

## Data Analysis
- Listing the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary
- Listing employees who were hired in 1986   
- Listing the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates
- Listing the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- Listing all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B"
- Listing all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- Listing all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- In descending order, listing the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name
